Let me write that down again to make sure I have it right:\\n\\n(log₂(9 - 2ˣ)) / (3 - x) = 1.\\n\\nOkay, so the logarithm part is in the numerator, and the denominator is (3 - x). Since the equation equals 1, that means when I multiply both sides by (3 - x), I can get rid of the denominator. Let me do that first:\\n\\nlog₂(9 - 2ˣ) = 1 * (3 - x)\\n=> log₂(9 - 2ˣ) = 3 - x.\\n\\nNow, to get rid of the logarithm, I can rewrite this equation in exponential form. Remember that log_b(a) = c is equivalent to b^c = a. So applying that here:\\n\\n2^(3 - x) = 9 - 2ˣ.\\n\\nHmm, okay. Let me simplify 2^(3 - x). That can be written as 2³ / 2ˣ, right? Because 2^(a - b) = 2^a / 2^b. So:\\n\\n8 / 2ˣ = 9 - 2ˣ.\\n\\nNow, this looks like an equation where I can substitute y = 2ˣ to make it easier. Let's try that. Let y = 2ˣ. Then the equation becomes:\\n\\n8 / y = 9 - y.\\n\\nMultiply both sides by y to eliminate the denominator:\\n\\n8 = (9 - y)y\\n=> 8 = 9y - y².\\n\\nLet's rearrange this into a standard quadratic equation:\\n\\ny² - 9y + 8 = 0.\\n\\nNow, solving this quadratic equation. Let's factor it. Looking for two numbers that multiply to 8 and add up to -9. Wait, actually, the quadratic is y² -9y +8. So, factors of 8 that add up to 9? Hmm, 1 and 8. Because 1*8=8 and 1+8=9. But since the middle term is -9y, the factors would be (y - 1)(y - 8) = 0. Let's check:\\n\\n(y - 1)(y - 8) = y² -8y - y +8 = y² -9y +8. Yep, that's correct.\\n\\nSo the solutions are y = 1 and y = 8.\\n\\nBut remember, we set y = 2ˣ. So we can substitute back:\\n\\nFor y = 1:\\n2ˣ = 1\\n=> x = log₂(1)\\n=> x = 0.\\n\\nFor y = 8:\\n2ˣ = 8\\n=> x = log₂(8)\\n=> x = 3.\\n\\nWait, hold on. But we have to check these solutions in the original equation because sometimes when we manipulate equations, especially involving logarithms, we can introduce extraneous solutions.\\n\\nLet's check x = 0 first.\\n\\nOriginal equation: [log₂(9 - 2⁰)] / (3 - 0) = 1.\\n\\n2⁰ is 1, so 9 - 1 = 8. log₂(8) is 3, because 2³=8. So numerator is 3, denominator is 3, so 3/3=1. That works. So x=0 is valid.\\n\\nNow check x=3.\\n\\nOriginal equation: [log₂(9 - 2³)] / (3 - 3) = 1.\\n\\n2³=8. 9 -8=1. log₂(1)=0. Denominator is 0. So we have 0/0, which is undefined. Oh no! Division by zero is undefined, so x=3 is not a valid solution. Therefore, we must reject x=3.\\n\\nSo the only solution is x=0.\\n\\nBut let me double-check everything to be sure. Let's verify algebra steps again.\\n\\nStarting equation: log₂(9 - 2ˣ)/(3 -x) =1.\\n\\nMultiply both sides by (3 -x): log₂(9 -2ˣ)=3 -x.\\n\\nExponential form: 2^{3 -x} =9 -2ˣ.\\n\\nExpressed as 8/2ˣ =9 -2ˣ.\\n\\nMultiply by 2ˣ: 8=9*2ˣ - (2ˣ)^2.\\n\\nLet y=2ˣ: 8=9y - y² => y² -9y +8=0 => y=1 and y=8.\\n\\nSo 2ˣ=1 gives x=0, and 2ˣ=8 gives x=3. But x=3 makes denominator zero in original equation. So only x=0 is valid.
